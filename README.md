## Everything About Audio in Machines

Basic knowledge of sound in the machines:

- What are sample, sample rate and the relationship of them?
- The relationship between sample rate and audio quality.
- What is waveform and Waveform shape?
- What is frequency, phase, envelope, reverb and temporal variation of a waveform?
- Studying on a real-life voice audio file.
- Studying about basic notes in song, then build a piano simulator (run ./piano_app/main.py).
- Fourier transform in audio.

What's coming soon?
- Buidling a machine to convert the voice of person A into person B in real time.
